I'm a back end developer and aspiring content creator, trying to build my own version of the digital world step by step. All coding projects are developed from the ground up, from planning and design to solving real-world problems with code.

<details><summary><h3>👨‍💻 My journey in the world of programming </h3></summary> 
  
I started my coding journey as a naive systems analysis and development student with a passion for learning everything I could about the world of programming - code, languages, Linux, theory. And all the while, I was teaching myself iOS development with the dream of building my own app, but that was soon overshadowed by my desire to excel at Java. A desire that still causes me some stress to this day xD. However, I have another desire that I have been pursuing throughout this time - creating content on YouTube. And that has been my focus since then, with some difficulties to begin with, but nothing that, with persistence, cannot be overcome.
